Created a Raspberry Pi Security System using a screen, keypad, motion sensor, and an alarm. 
Made sure only authorized people can control it with a secure password. 
The system has three modes: Armed, Unarmed, and Password Change. 
When in Armed mode, the motion sensor triggers an alarm if it detects any unauthorized movement, improving intruder detection.
